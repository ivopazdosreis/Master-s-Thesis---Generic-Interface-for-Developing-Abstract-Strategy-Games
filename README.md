# Master-s-Thesis---Generic-Interface-for-Developing-Abstract-Strategy-Games

For my final year R&D project I designed and developed a software platform capable of creating several distinct board games depending on user’s choices, entitled “Generic Interface for Developing Abstract Strategy Games”. Covering the fields of Artificial Intelligence, General Game Playing Systems and Interface Design. Developed with C#, WPF and XML.

The main focus of the project was the development of the application AbstractGamesCreationKit. Designed as a wizard dialog where the user can create an abstract strategy game in steps by defining the game board, pieces, goals and other rules. The game can then be exported as a file and played using the Zillions of Games platform (http://www.zillions-of-games.com/index.html)
